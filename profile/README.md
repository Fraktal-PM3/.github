## Project Overview

This project develops a digital logistics platform designed to transform transportation in rural areas through decentralized resource sharing. The platform connects actors with transportation needs to those with available capacity, creating an efficient surplus-based system that reduces waste and environmental impact while maintaining user privacy through decentralized architecture.

The core innovation lies in combining automated trust mechanisms with seamless integration capabilities, allowing both individuals and businesses to participate without disrupting existing operational procedures. An algorithmic reputation system ensures reliable interactions between participants while preserving anonymity and data integrity across the network.

The project will conclude with a pilot study in Norrbotten to validate real-world performance and test the platform's effectiveness in a rural logistics environment. This initiative is conducted as part of course D7017E "Project in Information Technology" at Lule책 University of Technology, representing a practical application of modern information technologies to address sustainability challenges in rural logistics.
